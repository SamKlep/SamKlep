## My name is Sam Klepper

I am a full-stack developer from Houston, TX. I have a passion for all things tech and have been intrigued by it all my life-- especially cryptocrrency! I primarily work in Javascript, NodeJS and React, but have recently started dabbling with Python and Django-- to get a feel of web development in other languages.

ðŸ‘” Iâ€™m currently working on a Crypto swapping app in <strong>React</strong>.

ðŸ“ˆ Iâ€™m currently learning <strong>3js</strong>.

ðŸ’¬ Ask me about running <strong>OpenCV</strong> and <strong>Object Detection</strong>  on a <strong>Raspberry Pi</strong>.
